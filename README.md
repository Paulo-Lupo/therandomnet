# therandomnet

The Random net is a single player game idea that was developed with the intent to entertain while at the same time help the player with critical thinking. 

You are given a 3x3 grid with random numbers from 1 to whatever you define. Every time you move from one of the slots in the grid to the next, the number in the grid you were in goes down until it reaches 0. If it reaches 0 that means that you will not be able to go back to that slot of the grid. The purpose of the game is to move as much as possible along the grid until there is nowhere for you to go. Each time you move you gain one point, and the maximum amount of points you could have gotten is displayed when you are done with the game so you can compare if you followed the right path.


# What is to come
This version of the project is only the first one. The next steps include the polishing and perfection of the algorithm so it runs with the least amount of resources. Next, we will work on a GUI environment where the game will be executed. From that we plan on expanding the game to different types of maps and implementing extra elements to it.
